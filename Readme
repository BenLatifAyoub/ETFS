# Scrap

A collection of Python scripts for scraping and processing ETF data.

## Folder Structure

- `Combined.py`, `amundietf.py`, `Ishare.py`, `vanguard.py`, `Xtrackers.py`: Main scraping scripts for different ETF providers.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `output/`: Processed ETF data in JSON format.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install
   ```

2. **Add your API key:**  
   All scripts require an API key.  
   Open the script you want to run and find the line:
   ```python
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY = "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"
   ```
   Replace `"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"` with your Firecrawl key.

3. **Run a script:**
   ```sh
   python Combined.py
   ```
   Or run any of the provider-specific scripts.

## Output

- Scraped data is saved in `output/` as JSON files.
